  # During nucleation of cracks, the diffused crack is
  # phi*exp(-|x|/l_phi), and the absolute gradient field is
  # 1/l_phi*phi_max*exp(-|x|/l_phi).

  # If the crack is fully generated (phi_max=1). We want (and only want)
  # cells, whose absolute gradient values (|grad|) are higher than that at
  # |x|=a2*l_phi (|grad|>|grad_2|=1/l_phi*exp(-a2)), to be refined. The
  # region is defined here as influential region with a width a2*l_phi, which
  # ultimately impacts our overall computational cost.

  # For growing cracks (phi_max<1), we want cells satisfying
  #                   |grad|>1/l_phi*phi_max*exp(-a2)
  # to be refined. Since phi<=phi_max (i.e., the investigated cell may not be
  # at the center of cracks), if we directly use 1/l_phi*phi*exp(-a2) as the
  # threshold, the final refined region is enlarged (when the phi value at
  # somewhere else reaches 1), compared to the condition |grad|>|grad_2|
  # stated above. Therefore, we decide to set a reference value of phi_max,
  # denoted as phi_ref, so that when phi is growing and when the maximum phi
  # reaches phi_ref, nearby cells within the initial influential region
  # |x|<a1*l_phi and
  #                 |grad|>|grad_1|=1/l_phi*phi_ref*exp(-a1)
  # is refined.
  # To make the criteria consistent when phi_max reaches 1, we expect
  #                   exp(-a2)=phi_ref*exp(-a1)
  # and this is how phi_ref is determined.
